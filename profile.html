        <p class="para3"> Italic Recipie  Book is a digital magazine that offers an insider’s perspective to the Bel Paese – one that goes beyond the stereotypes and provides insight into the nuances of Italy and its longstanding traditions. Our mission is to inspire readers to discover the “infinity of Italy” through curated editorial features including travel guides, hotel reviews, lifestyle round-ups and partnerships with Italian brands and businesses.

          We believe that the best way to experience the beauty of Italy is to explore the country widely and slowly, taking the time to meet its locals, savor its cuisine and honor its traditions. That’s why we strive to highlight its small towns, historic homes, local artisans, family-run wineries and inspiring entrepreneurs.
          
         Italic recipe Book  was founded in 2018 and rebranded in 2020.</p>
